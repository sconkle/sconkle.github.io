## About Me

I graduated in May 2021 from Purdue University with a B.S. in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering and was a Presidential Scholarship Recipient all 4 years I attended Purdue. At Purdue I was a 3 year Resident Assistant at Cary Quadrangle, the largest all male residence hall on campus. My responsibilities as an RA included creating a welcoming and open floor community for the primarily first year residents and help them get adapted to college life and education. I was also responsible for upholding policy on the floor and ensuring physical and emotional safety of all my residents. I was also involved in the Purdue Running Club and Purdue Orbital, a student-run rocketry organization with the goal of launching a balloon/rocket hybrid payload into orbit.
