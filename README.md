## About Me

I graduated in May 2021 from Purdue University with a B.S. in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering and was a Presidential Scholarship Recipient all 4 years I attended Purdue. At Purdue I was a 3 year Resident Assistant at Cary Quadrangle, the largest all male residence hall on campus. My responsibilities as an RA included creating a welcoming and open floor community for the primarily first year residents and help them get adapted to college life and education. I was also responsible for upholding policy on the floor and ensuring physical and emotional safety of all my residents. I was also involved in the Purdue Running Club and Purdue Orbital, a student-run rocketry organization with the goal of launching a balloon/rocket hybrid payload into orbit. 

I've spent the last ~2 years working at Empirical Systems Aerospace, a small electric aerospace company based in San Luis Obispo, CA. Here I got to experience the flexibility in tasking that a small company provides and I believe it helped me grow and gain experience in a lot of different disciplines in a relavitely small amount of time. I got to develop a Detection and Avoidance (DAA) software prototype for future Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles that utilized current regulatory TCAS math and procedures. I also helped modify and integrate pre trained vision tracking algorithms like GOTURN and KCF into our Group 1 UAS. Beyond this, I also worked closely with the Software Team and Flight Test Team, helping with coding, integration, and building of our flight computers and flight software and hardware. I also got to assist in flight tests and vehicle checkouts. After learning and growing more as an engineer, I am now looking for my next opprotunity to make an impact in a new role.
