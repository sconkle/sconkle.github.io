##Research Project: Gemini 8

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, I participated in the Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference, presenting on a special panel, Apollo in the Archives, specifically celebrating the rich history present in the Purdue Archives, which hold some of the most complete records of Neil Armstrong's personal files. For my research, I decided to focus on Armstrong's first mission in command, Gemini 8. Gemini 8 almost ended in disaster when a tight timetable forced corners to be cut, almost resulting in the deaths of both Armstrong and his co-pilot David Scott. I dived deep into the Purdue Archives, doing original research on what led to this near-disaster that could have spelled the end of NASA's moonshot. My research taught me a lot about the training that astronauts have to go through in order to prepare for these missions, and just how much documentation and systems engineering is needed to pull off a mission of this scale. My paper was featured in the Fall 2019 edition of Purdue's undergraduate research magazine, THINK. I was also an award finalist for the Apollo in the Archives section of the Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference.
