## Project NEXTSTEP
In my spring semester of 2021, I was apart of a unique senior design experience entitled Project NEXTSTEP. All work and meetings in the class were entirely online, 
which proved to be a challenge for group work and communication. Additionally, instead of a traditional senior design in a small group of 10 or less, the entire class of 90 seniors
were all working on the same project, and we were broken up into subteams within the one project goal. Instead of a regular group project, collaborating with this many people was 
akin to working at a small aerospace company. 
The goal of Project NEXTSTEP was to establish a lunar colony over a 10 year period with an annual budget of 10 billion dollars. The focus of the design was to maximize comfort of
the lunar colonists and to also maximize the number of colonists on the base. Working under Dr. James Longuski, our team got to work researching and designing the lunar base for 
our primary 'customer' Dr. Andrew Aldrin. 
I was assigned to the CAD subteam of the project and my team and I were responsible for creating detailed and accurate 3D CAD models of all systems, habitats, and vehicles present 
on the lunar base. This entailed communcating across different subteams to get an idea of what system they wanted to create with given restraints such as mass and volume, since all 
systems needed to be sent up in launch vehicles such as the Falcon Heavy and the Space X Starship.
