My Senior year, I took AAE 550 - Multidisciplinary Design Optimization taught by the head of the school of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Proffessor William Crossley. This class was easily one of my favorite classes of my undegraduate education and I learned a lot about different methods for multi objective optimization of systems. For my final, I focused on using a weighted sum approach with sequential quadratic programming algorithm to find the optimum bamboo-maple composite longboard deck to minimize deflection and weight, for a relaxed and stablel cruising ride. Using Matlab's fmincon, I found the ideal composite to be 60% bamboo and 40% maple, which is comparable to real composite boards present on the market.
